    <h1>AI Demands a New Body: Rise of AI-Native Devices</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 26, 2025</p>

    <p>After years of AI being confined to screens, keyboards, and cloud APIs, a new form factor is emerging: AI-native devices. Humane, Rabbit R1, and Apple‚Äôs AI-enabled Vision Pro headset point to a future where artificial intelligence finds its own hardware skin ‚Äî where the device is designed from the ground up for continuous, contextual interaction with a model that "knows you."</p>

    <p>What defines these devices? They are not simply smartphones with AI apps ‚Äî they are intelligent agents in themselves. Always-on, voice-first, context-aware, gesture-sensitive, screen-optional. They embody AI as interface ‚Äî and perhaps, eventually, as identity.</p>

    <p>As Sam Altman noted, future AI systems will likely have ‚Äúunbelievable context‚Äù about your life. What kind of body can carry that context? How do you create hardware that respects privacy while enabling intimacy with your assistant? These questions are becoming central to the design of personal computing.</p>

    <p>AI-native devices may shape not just the way we compute, but how we relate to technology itself. They mark a transition from devices that serve us, to devices that understand us.</p>
