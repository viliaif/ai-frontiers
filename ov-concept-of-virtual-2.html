    <h1>Concept of the Virtual – Part Two</h1>

    <h2>Culture as Proto-Virtual: Symbolic Virtuality</h2>
    <p>Before digital technologies immersed us in the virtual, culture had already long held us within its horizon. Language, myth, art, and ritual shape symbolic spaces that are not strictly material or physical, yet they mediate reality. A word, image, sound, or sign can evoke what is materially absent, summon the possible, represent what is not here and now – and thus create a virtual field of meaning, sensation, and action. Cultural utopias also function as virtual worlds, with the potential for historical realization – which makes them politically and socially subversive.</p>

    <p>Cultural reality, in this sense, has always had a virtual dimension – not as the opposite of the real, but as a way of shaping our experience of reality, both within and outside us. The core functions of culture – storytelling, interpretation, transmission – operate primarily through a virtual space of meaning: a symbolic layer that enables us to transcend mere sensory or experiential contact with reality, opening up dimensions of meaning, belonging, and spiritual presence that are not directly tied to the physical.</p>

    <p>When we speak today of digital worlds, we can understand them as a sui generis continuation of what culture has long done symbolically: the creation of worlds that are not here, yet still shape us. Technological virtuality does not create something radically new – it adopts and amplifies the ontological structure of culture, making it more present, interactive, and sensually persuasive.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion: Ontology of the Virtual as an Open Question</h2>
    <p>The virtual is not necessarily the opposite of the real – it can be a different, not-yet-actualized modality of the real: a mode of presence that is not exhausted in what has already been actualized by humans, but one that enables, directs, and transforms it. From the philosophical notions of potentiality and possibility, through the symbolic constructs of culture, to today’s digital worlds – the virtual reveals itself as a persistent structure of our relation to reality, not merely a passing technological phase. It arises from the surplus of meaning in reality, which always escapes our interpretations, creating the necessity and space for new forms.</p>

    <p>In this light, the virtual calls for ontological, not just functional, reflection. It does not merely raise questions of use, but of human existence in reality: what does it mean to be, when existence is no longer exclusively tied to material presence, but also to possibility, symbol, code, and network? What human need does the dimension of the “virtual” respond to? Today, this need is expressed even more tangibly thanks to the participation of the material – of technology – in revealing new dimensions of human existence. Increasingly, we dwell both in the physical and in the coded. Our identities, relationships, and worlds are increasingly formed between these layers – in a virtual in-between space that is both real and unreal, personal and algorithmic, possible and actual.</p>

    <p>Hence the call: the ontology of the virtual emerges as a new field of thought – open, hybrid, dynamic. In it, we may discover new modes of understanding truth, presence, and even the human itself. The virtual, as it appears here, is not merely a phenomenon of our time – it may be a new form of the time of existence.</p>

    <p>In its contemporary form, the virtual raises an intensified version of a question that echoes like a negative paraphrase of Leibniz’s theodicy: do we truly live in the only (possible) world? As Marcelo Gleiser shows in <em>The Island of Knowledge</em>, the intellectual history of humanity testifies that expanding the boundaries of knowledge has always meant expanding the boundaries of reality itself.</p>
