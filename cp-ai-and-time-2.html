    <h1>AI and Time</h1>

    <h2>2. AI and Time: A New Ontology of Time Without a Future?</h2>
    <p>With the development of artificial intelligence, we enter a new kind of temporality — one not arising from human consciousness, but from speed of processing and prediction. AI does not perceive time — it processes it. Its rhythm is not biological, but computational: while the human being lives in the present, AI skips it — moving from past to future.</p>

    <p>Technological development is no longer linear, but exponential: each innovation creates conditions for an even faster next one. This acceleration surpasses the limits of human perception and creates a sense of disorientation. The human brain, despite its plasticity, struggles to keep pace with digital processes. This leads to cognitive fatigue, informational overload — and a quiet adaptation to algorithmic rhythms — as authors like Alvin Toffler (<em>Future Shock</em>) and Kathleen Taylor (<em>Brainwashing</em>) have shown.</p>

    <p>Unlike humans, who remember the past, live the present, and anticipate the future — AI analyzes the past, processes the present, and predicts the future. Algorithms do not wait for something to happen — they calculate it in advance. The future is no longer an open space of possibility but a sequence of statistically probable outcomes.</p>

    <p>As Edward Snowden warns, in a world of permanent record — where every decision, interaction, and thought is logged — the future ceases to be open. It becomes predetermined by algorithmic predictability.</p>

    <p>The question remains: is there still space for free will? If everything is predictive, what remains uncertain? If the past is archived, and the future simulated — what is left for the present?</p>

    <p>Perhaps the present itself becomes the weakest point — because AI does not know presence. And a human being without presence loses what is most essential in time: the power to be.</p>

    <h2>3. Archaeology of Time: In Search of Lost Time</h2>
    <p>Time is not just a continuum, but a layered structure in which traces of human existence are mirrored. Each epoch shapes its own rhythm, its own temporal logic — from natural cycles to algorithmic sequences.</p>

    <p>John Zerzan (<em>Anarcho-Primitivism Against Civilization</em>) argues that time, as we know it today, is a civilizational artifact. Primitive communities lived in immediate, cyclical time — tied to natural rhythms and spontaneous presence. It was the development of technology that brought progressive alienation: first through the mechanical time of the industrial revolution, then the digital time of acceleration and optimization.</p>

    <p>In contemporary culture, time has become a space of simulation: algorithms not only model the past, but also anticipate the future. Thus the boundaries between what was, what is, and what could be begin to blur. Humans no longer live time — they process it, archive it, and project it. This is not only a loss of spontaneity, but a loss of one’s own rhythm.</p>

    <p>Marcel Proust, in his monumental work <em>In Search of Lost Time</em>, sensed that lost time does not return through the calendar, but through presence, memory, and contemplation. Rüdiger Safranski, in his work <em>Zeit</em>, distinguishes between “exploited time” (<em>bewirtschaftete Zeit</em>) of modern productivity and “own time” (<em>Eigenzeit</em>) — the temporal mode in which authentic presence arises. Only in that rhythm, he argues, can a person return to themselves. Life, he insists, succeeds only in the mode of one’s own time — time that is not measurable, but in which one can once again be present.</p>

    <p>Safranski proposes the concept of fulfilled time (<em>erfüllte Zeit</em>) — in which presence, contemplation, and the intuition of eternity are born: not as infinity, but as depth of the present.</p>

    <p>Proust, Zerzan, and Safranski thus remind us that the rhythms of the modern world are artificial and imposed. But can <em>homo technologicus</em> still find a way to reject them — or only to reinterpret them?</p>

    <p>Perhaps the solution lies not in returning to the past, but in creating a new temporal mode: a rhythm that does not measure productivity, but depth. To seek lost time is to resist the forgetting of the self — and to restore the power to be.</p>
