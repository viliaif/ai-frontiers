    <h1>The Concept of the Virtual – Part II</h1>

    <h2>The Weak Concept: The Virtual as Ontological Potential</h2>

    <p>Although the term “virtual” entered broader usage through digital technologies, it has deep philosophical and ontological roots in the tension between the possible and the actual — a tension that opens space for understanding it as a mode of being, not merely a surrogate of reality. The virtual — understood as what is not actual but could be — has been present since Aristotle. His distinction between dynamis (potentiality) and energeia (actualization) points to a reality not exhausted by appearances but inclusive of what could be.</p>

    <p>In Scholastic philosophy, especially with Thomas Aquinas, we find the term virtus — an internal power or potential that has not yet been expressed but exists in reality. The word “virtual” itself stems from the Latin virtus, indicating strength, efficacy, or potential awaiting realization. Thus, etymologically, “virtual” does not mean false or unreal, but something that has the power of existence without being actualized. Later, Henri Bergson introduced the concept of durée (duration) as an unbroken flow that includes what is not yet actual, while Gilles Deleuze in the 20th century explicitly treated the virtual as real but non-actual — a positive ontological dimension.</p>

    <p>In all these examples, the virtual is not understood as illusion or copy, but as a real possibility — something that exists on the border between the known and the emerging, the actual and the possible. Its potential does not lie merely in technological simulations but in a fundamental ontological structure that transcends current presence. The virtual, therefore, becomes a philosophical tool for rethinking being, temporality, and becoming in a way that recognizes the reality of what has not yet arrived.</p>

    <p>This “weak” concept of the virtual invites us to reconsider our understanding of presence — not only what is visible or actual, but also what is latent, possible, and becoming. It enables a new kind of sensitivity to the layers of existence and meaning that technology may reveal, but which are not reducible to it. In this way, the virtual ceases to be a mere surface or simulation and becomes a key to exploring the deep textures of our experience of the real.</p>
