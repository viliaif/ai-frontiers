    <h1>Denmark Introduces Law to Protect the Human Face in the Age of AI</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> July 10, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. New Ethical Regulation</h2>
    <p>In a pioneering move within the EU, Denmark has proposed a law that explicitly prohibits the non-consensual creation and distribution of AI-generated images that simulate real people’s faces. The initiative was prompted by the increasing use of deepfake technology for manipulation, blackmail, and harassment.</p>

    <h2>2. The Law and Its Provisions</h2>
    <p>According to the bill, creating or sharing AI-generated images that portray a real person's face without their explicit consent may result in fines or imprisonment. The law emphasizes that personal identity must be protected in the digital realm just as it is in the physical world. The proposal also includes stronger penalties if such content is used with intent to deceive, threaten, or harm.</p>

    <h2>3. Broader Ethical and Philosophical Implications</h2>
    <p>The Danish debate goes beyond legal technicalities and touches upon deeper philosophical issues: what does it mean to protect the human face in an era where it can be replicated, manipulated, and disseminated by machines? Some ethicists argue that the face is not merely an image, but a symbolic and relational phenomenon — the essence of interpersonal presence.</p>

    <h2>4. Reactions and International Context</h2>
    <p>While the EU AI Act already addresses biometric data and deepfakes to some extent, the Danish initiative stands out for its emphasis on human dignity and consent. Human rights groups have welcomed the law, while some tech companies warn of potential limits to generative creativity. Nonetheless, Denmark’s move is seen as a leading example in the ongoing battle to ethically govern artificial intelligence.</p>
