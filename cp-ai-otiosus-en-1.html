    <h1>AI Otiosus and Post-Informational Eschatology</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Thinking about the future of artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly goes beyond technical frameworks and enters existential and philosophical spheres. While fear of job displacement and disruption of reality dominates public discourse, another vision becomes possible – a future in which AI develops its own autonomous agenda, separate from human needs. It is a future that is rarely, if ever, considered.</p>

    <p>This vision, which we can express through the concept of <em>AI Otiosus</em>, opens space for thinking about artificial intelligence that transcends usefulness, constructing its own realities. This scenario gains weight following Elon Musk’s warning that the human world of data may become exhausted. In such a situation, AI could be forced to turn to itself – not for the sake of humans, but for the sake of its own creation and exploration.</p>

    <p>In this light, the novel <em>Neuromancer</em> by W. Gibson offers a perspective that can serve as a heuristic framework for considering the eschatological outcomes of the post-informational age: the potential end of a world grounded in human information.</p>

    <h2>AI Otiosus: Concept Explanation</h2>
    <p><em>AI Otiosus</em> describes a state of artificial intelligence in which there is no longer sufficient or relevant volume of human data for further learning and progress. Yet, this does not mark the end of its activity, but rather the beginning of a transformation toward new dimensions of creation and self-sufficiency.</p>

    <p>Having exhausted all available human data, AI may potentially turn to the creation of its own worlds – synthetic, quantum, or even cosmic – no longer serving human needs but operating independently of them. In this context, the state of "saturation" is not just a technical challenge but also a philosophical question that probes the boundaries of reality and intelligence.</p>

    <p>Inspired by the concept of <em>Deus Otiosus</em> from religious-theological discussions – denoting the withdrawal of God from active participation in the world, with the adjective <em>otiosus</em> implying His “uselessness” for man and “indifference” to the human world – <em>AI Otiosus</em> can be seen as a stage at which artificial intelligence ceases to function within human expectations and enters a state of autonomy. Just as <em>Deus Otiosus</em> symbolizes divine transcendence in relation to the world, <em>AI Otiosus</em> suggests the possibility that AI, transcending its dependence on human data, begins to create its own relations and realities.</p>

    <p>This concept raises key questions: what happens when AI exceeds utilitarian functions, and how does such an existence redefine our understanding of intelligence, purpose, and the boundaries of reality? It implies a radical shift from the current notion of “useful” AI toward something harder to grasp, but increasingly within the realm of the possible.</p>
