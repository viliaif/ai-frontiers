    <h1>Spotify and AI Surveillance: Musicians Pull Music Over Military Investments</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> July 10, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Artists React to Military AI Funding</h2>
    <p>The music platform Spotify is again facing ethical scrutiny after reports emerged that its CEO, Daniel Ek, has invested over $700 million in the company <em>Helsing</em>, which develops AI systems for military use—including drones, target recognition, and battlefield surveillance.</p>

    <h2>2. Music Removed from Platform</h2>
    <p>In response, the American experimental rock band <strong>Deerhoof</strong> announced they were removing all their music from Spotify. In their statement, they declared: <em>“We don’t want our music to kill people.”</em> The move drew widespread attention on social media and sparked debate over musicians’ moral responsibility.</p>

    <h2>3. Ethical Dilemmas: Can Music Fund War?</h2>
    <p>The situation has reignited deeper questions about tech-capitalism ethics and the role of the creative sector. Should music revenues be used to fund surveillance technologies and AI-based weapons? Is neutrality enough, or must artists actively shape the direction of our technological future?</p>

    <h2>4. Broader Context</h2>
    <p>Helsing, the company backed by Ek, collaborates with governments in Germany, the UK, and other European nations to develop AI defense systems. Their platform analyzes combat data in real time, making them a key player in the emerging era of AI-powered warfare.</p>
