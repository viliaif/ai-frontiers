    <h1>Concept of the Virtual</h1>

    <p>Virtual is everywhere around us today. We could say that we have already been imperceptibly immersed in it: it enters our lives through augmented reality glasses, data streams, digital avatars, and algorithmic spaces where more and more of everyday life unfolds. But despite its omnipresence, the concept of the virtual remains difficult to grasp. What does it actually mean for something to be “virtual”? Is it a surrogate for reality, its simulation, or a different mode of existence? Virtual is not just a technical novelty of the age – it is a phenomenon with deep historical and philosophical roots that demands careful and critical analysis. In this light, we want to show that behind the “strong” technical meaning of the virtual lies a quieter and deeper intellectual dimension – the “weak concept” – which points us to new forms of presence, reality, and meaning.</p>

    <h2>Strong Concept: The Virtual as a Technological Regime of Our Time</h2>

    <p>In contemporary discourse, the concept of the virtual primarily appears in the context of digital technologies. Virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), the metaverse, digital avatars, and simulated worlds – these are all phenomena that construct experiential spaces that transcend the boundaries of physical reality. In this sense, the virtual becomes a “strong concept” – clearly defined, operational, technologically developed, and socially present.</p>

    <p>What characterizes the reality encompassed by this concept is its ability to replace or transform real experience: the virtual is no longer a surrogate, but a new form of existence in which communication, work, entertainment, and even relationships occur. Increasingly, the virtual does not merely serve as a medium of representation or play but is shaped as its own environment of being, with its own laws, forms of presence, and emotional resonances. In this context, when the links between the "real" and the virtual seem broken, the virtual can even be viewed as a kind of parallel “reality” – an alternative to “standard” reality.</p>

    <p>Yet the power of the virtual – its capacity to shape the experience of reality – raises questions that go beyond the technical level. If it is possible to be and act within a virtual space, then we must ask: does it acquire ontological dimensions? Is the virtual “unreal,” or is it a different way of being – one that requires a different way of thinking about reality?</p>

    <p>This understanding and influence of the virtual brings to the fore an ancient and somewhat forgotten ontological question: what is reality? How does the virtual affect our conception of our own experience of “reality”? To what extent does it alter – or perhaps reveal – it? This opens the space for a deeper philosophical analysis of the virtual – one that does not arise from technology, but from the very structure of being.</p>
