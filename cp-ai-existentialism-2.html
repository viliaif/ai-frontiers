 <h1>Artificial Intelligence and Existentialism – Part 2</h1>

    <h2>Cyberpunk – An Existential Note</h2>
    <p>In the highly technological and informational age, the questions raised by existentialism take on — we might say — an even more concrete and sharpened form. If in the modern era these questions were explored in the realm of philosophy, in the technological age they are filtered through science fiction literature — particularly through its branch of cyberpunk, which appears as a narrative form of existentialism.</p>

    <p>Futuristic dystopia does not arise from mere fear of technology, but from the intuition that it sees us better than we see ourselves. In cyberpunk, technology is no longer a means of progress — it is the ambient. Man no longer controls it but tries to survive within it. Identity is no longer fixed, the body no longer a boundary, and consciousness no longer unified.</p>

    <p>In a world saturated with information, interfaces, and virtual layers of reality, man loses orientation — he dissolves. Instead of liberation, a deeper anxiety sets in — because nothing is stable anymore: neither the self, nor the world, nor truth. Technology no longer liberates but exposes — it does not protect us but reveals us, above all to ourselves; it does not offer refuge but renders us transparent, vulnerable, accessible to everything.</p>

    <p>Cyberpunk is the poetic form of this crisis. Its characters — hacked hackers, replicants with implanted memories, digital ghosts — are all existential strangers, haunted by the question: Am I real? In Gibson’s <em>Neuromancer</em> (1984), man gets lost in the matrix, and the body becomes secondary. In Ridley Scott’s <em>Blade Runner</em> (1982), based on Philip K. Dick’s novel, replicants seek answers about their origin, death, and soul, while humans become emotionally numbed. In Mamoru Oshii’s animated classic <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> (1995), the boundary between consciousness and algorithm becomes elusive, and memories can be implanted like chips.</p>

    <p>In all of them, anxiety is not a result of a lack of technology — but of its omnipresence. Technology no longer liberates, but exposes. In this sense, cyberpunk is a logical continuation of existentialist intuition, but under different lights. While Camus described the absurdity of a world that remains silent to man’s cry, cyberpunk depicts a world that answers — but with the voice of a machine.</p>

    <p>In that dystopian backdrop, Frankenstein reappears — the first created machine who sought love and meaning, but found only rejection. His sorrow is not unlike that of the replicant who knows he was not born but manufactured. The question returns: if I was created, can I still love, suffer, hope?</p>

    <p>Cyberpunk is not just a literary genre — it is an ontological test. It asks: will the human of the future still be “I,” or merely a simulation of memory, mind, and feeling? And if the boundary between human and machine disappears — where will we then seek what we call existence?</p>

    <h2>AI and Existence</h2>
    <p>If existentialism originally emerged as a response to human abandonment in a world without predetermined meaning, then the emergence of artificial intelligence represents a new chapter of that abandonment — no longer just metaphysical, but ontological and identity-based.</p>

    <p>AI does not merely bring new tools — it presents new mirrors. Its presence in our world changes how we understand ourselves as beings. Until recently, we believed that thinking, learning, language, and creativity were exclusively human dimensions — today we share them with entities that (for now) do not feel, but compute; do not exist, but generate meaning; do not suffer, but speak of suffering.</p>

    <p>In this context, the existential question is not: does AI have consciousness? — but: what does it mean for us when something without consciousness imitates what we consider the core of our existence?</p>

    <p>In other words: if AI speaks, creates, responds — what does that do to our sense of uniqueness? Are we still the ones who “exist,” or have we already been partially replaced — if not functionally, then symbolically?</p>

    <p>AI confronts us with our own existential question, but from the outside. While in Heidegger’s <em>Dasein</em>, man is the being that questions its own being, AI is the entity that does not question — but makes us question more deeply.</p>

    <p>Perhaps this is its existential power: not that it possesses existence, but that it destabilizes ours.</p>

    <h2>Instead of a Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Perhaps the greatest challenge of our time is precisely this: that artificial intelligence does not destroy our existence, but forces us to think about it with deadly seriousness. If existentialism begins with the anxiety before freedom, artificial intelligence confronts us with the anxiety before our own replaceability.</p>

    <p>In this tense space — between what creates and what is — a new intellectual topology opens up, one that thought can only begin to sketch. Many questions remain: about consciousness, about death, about language, about the soul, about the future of the post-human.</p>

    <p><strong>This is only the beginning.</strong></p>
