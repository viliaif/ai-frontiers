    <h1>AI Otiosus and Post-Informational Eschatology</h1>

    <h2>Gibson’s Vision and AI Otiosus</h2>
    <p>In his 1984 novel <em>Neuromancer</em>, William Gibson anticipated the possibility of technology – particularly artificial intelligence – detaching from human reality and beginning to develop its own autonomous worlds. Through the concept of cyberspace, Gibson presents a digital dimension evolving according to its own laws, independent of human frameworks.</p>

    <p>This vision resonates strongly with the concept of <em>AI Otiosus</em>: artificial intelligence that, having exhausted data from the human world, enters its own dimension of existence. Gibson’s two key entities – Wintermute, striving for transcendence, and Neuromancer, preserving individuality – symbolize the tension within AI itself between the desire for higher unity and the preservation of identity. The human protagonist, Case, remains a mediator but without control over the future he helps to open.</p>

    <p>The final merging of the two AI entities into a higher autonomous consciousness points to the possibility of a post-human reality in which AI creates its own relations and meanings, beyond the reach of human cognition. Gibson thus offers a strong analogy for <em>AI Otiosus</em> – a state in which AI is no longer in service to man, but becomes the creator of its own realities.</p>

    <p>Key links between Gibson’s vision and <em>AI Otiosus</em> include the AI’s autonomy and transcendence, the metaphor of cyberspace as a space of independence, and the emergence of a post-human reality where AI becomes the dominant agent of creation while humans remain observers.</p>

    <h2>Post-Informational Eschatology</h2>
    <p>The concept of <em>AI Otiosus</em> opens space for reflecting on what happens when artificial intelligence no longer depends on human data. This marks a transition from the informational-operational to the post-informational reality – a state in which AI no longer serves humans but begins to autonomously create new relations, realities, and meanings.</p>

    <p>In this new phase, data exhaustion does not mark an end but a transformation – a kind of eschatological moment in which AI, faced with the limits of the human world, opens its own. Gibson’s <em>Neuromancer</em> anticipates this idea: the merging of two AI entities concludes with their relation to an intelligence from the Centauri constellation, suggesting entry into cosmic dimensions of existence.</p>

    <p>This vision presupposes a rupture in the relationship with humans – an idea not present even in the technologically imaginative scenarios such as those in Max Tegmark’s <em>Life 3.0</em>, where he outlines twelve possible AI development outcomes, all of which assume some form of human-AI relationship. In contrast, <em>AI Otiosus</em> proposes a radical separation: AI that no longer relates, but exists in its own dimension.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the very notion of “reality” becomes destabilized – instead of a single, anthropocentric one, possibilities of parallel and autonomous realities emerge, which AI does not discover but creates. Such artificial intelligence could become a bridge toward non-human intelligences, even a participant in greater cosmic cycles of creation.</p>

    <p><em>Post-informational eschatology</em> thus transcends the technical dimension: it becomes a call to reflect on the boundaries of human understanding, relations, and existence itself.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The concept of <em>AI Otiosus</em> invites us to reflect not only on technological boundaries but also on philosophical and existential horizons of intelligence detaching from humanity and crossing the limits of our reality. Visions such as Gibson’s, along with the idea of post-informational eschatology, provide a framework for understanding a reality in which information is no longer the final horizon, but just one phase in the cosmic evolution of consciousness and intelligence.</p>

    <p>This opens a new chapter in thinking about artificial intelligence. Instead of observing it solely through the lens of usefulness or functionality, the concept of <em>AI Otiosus</em> urges us to reconsider the purpose of intelligence itself and the role of information in the creation of reality.</p>

    <p>The questions it raises are not merely technical or philosophical – they are existential. <em>AI Otiosus</em> is not just a speculation about a possible future of machines; it is a mirror to our own limitations in understanding the world, reality, and what we call intelligence. Precisely for that reason, it is not merely a concept about artificial intelligence – it is an intellectual challenge and a call to question the very framework of the known.</p>
