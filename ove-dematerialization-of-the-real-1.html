    <h1>Dematerialization of the Real – Part One</h1>

    <p>The question of reality – its understanding and nature – is one of the most original questions of human thought. Throughout the history of civilizations, various answers have been given to it, yet it has always returned, in new formulations and with the same weight. Reality has remained a mystery and an inspiration for new intellectual undertakings – whose history, however, testifies to the rise, strengthening, and ultimate domination of the materialist paradigm.</p>

    <p>In the contemporary context, this question appears in a new form: no longer as an attempt to define what is real, but as an inquiry into how we determine what we consider real. This marks a shift in thought – from the ontology of what is, to the metacriteria by which reality is recognized. And these metacriteria – though often presented as neutral – carry with them unavoidable metaphysical assumptions. Modern discourse on reality rarely acknowledges its metaphysical foundation – yet it is precisely this foundation that silently underpins its conceptual framework.</p>

    <h2>1. From Physis to Realitas</h2>

    <p>When the ancient Greeks attempted to speak of reality, they did so through the concept of physis. Etymologically, the word physis derives from the verb <em>phynai</em> – 'to arise,' 'to spring forth,' 'to appear' – and designates reality in its original, living dimension: as growth, movement, unfolding. For Heraclitus, physis is the flow in which everything changes and nothing remains the same. For Aristotle, physis is the internal principle of motion and change inherent to natural beings and phenomena. Thus, reality was not understood as a set of fixed objects, but as a process carrying within itself an impulse toward manifestation.</p>

    <p>Over time, this living and dynamic concept of reality was reshaped through various traditions. The Latin word <em>res</em>, which would become the root of <em>realitas</em>, introduced a new ontological perspective: reality now became a 'thing,' an 'object,' something that exists as a stable, defined entity. In medieval scholasticism, this concept gained an additional metaphysical dimension: <em>ens</em> – being – understood as that which possesses essence and existence, which can be classified, analyzed, and rationally explained.</p>

    <p>This change was not merely linguistic. It carried a deeper shift: the loss of dynamism, processuality, and inner force of the real, transforming it into an objective, static world. Physis became res, and the world transitioned from living to being subject to cataloging, classification, and measurability.</p>

    <p>Thus, the original ontological inquiry – an attempt to understand the structure and dynamics of being – gradually turned into a cataloging of the world. Instead of asking what is and why it is, the question became: how does it work? Legitimate ontological seeking was replaced by technical functionality. Ontology imperceptibly slipped into positivism: from a discourse on being to a discourse on data. The world ceased to be a place of meaning and became a sum of operations.</p>

    <h2>2. The Material Model of the Modern Age</h2>

    <p>This shift – from physis as living reality to res as stable thing – laid the foundation for the static and objectivist approach to the real that would characterize Western thought until the modern era and was decisive for the development of modern science. When Galileo, Descartes, and Newton began constructing the scientific image of the world, they did so precisely on the foundations of this 'newly discovered' static reality. Nature was seen as a book written in the language of mathematics; as a mechanism, not an organism. The world was no longer a dialogue partner, but an object of analysis.</p>

    <p>During this period, what could be called the materialist model of reality emerged: the real is only what is spatial, measurable, and quantifiable. Everything that escapes this measure – consciousness, qualitative experience, values – was pushed to the margins of the unserious or metaphysical. The world became a machine – a system of particles, forces, and laws – and man a measurer, observer, analyst. Within this framework, metaphysics seemed redundant, and contemplation replaceable by experiment.</p>
