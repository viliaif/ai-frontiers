    <h1>The Concept of the Virtual – Part II</h1>

    <h2>The Weak Concept: The Virtual as Ontological Potential</h2>
    <p>Although the term “virtual” entered broader usage through digital technologies, it has deep philosophical and ontological roots in the tension between the possible and the actual — a tension that opens space for understanding it as a mode of being, not merely a surrogate of reality. The virtual — understood as what is not actual but could be — has been present since Aristotle. His distinction between dynamis (potentiality) and energeia (actualization) points to a reality not exhausted by appearances but inclusive of what could be.</p>

    <p>In Scholastic philosophy, especially with Thomas Aquinas, we find the term virtus — an internal power or potential that has not yet been expressed but exists in reality. The word “virtual” itself stems from the Latin virtus, indicating strength, efficacy, or potential awaiting realization. Thus, etymologically, “virtual” does not mean false or unreal, but something that has the power of existence without being actualized. Later, Henri Bergson introduced the concept of durée (duration) as an unbroken flow that includes what is not yet actual, while Gilles Deleuze in the 20th century explicitly treated the virtual as real but non-actual — a positive ontological dimension.</p>

    <h2>Culture as Proto-Virtual</h2>
    <p>Virtuality does not begin with technology. From the earliest myths and symbolic representations, humanity has created mediated realities that transcend the immediate and material. Culture itself can be seen as a proto-virtual space: language, images, and rituals are not simply mirrors of the world but modes of shaping and transforming it. When we speak, write, imagine, or believe, we operate within frameworks that exceed what is tangibly present — we invoke meanings, project possibilities, and relate to absences.</p>

    <p>In this sense, every symbolic act is already virtual, in that it mobilizes meanings that are not entirely bound to the “here and now.” Memory, anticipation, imagination — all are virtual in structure. This anthropological dimension of the virtual shows that what we now encounter in technological forms has deep cultural and spiritual precedents. The digital revolution thus does not introduce the virtual from the outside, but amplifies and accelerates a latent human tendency to transcend immediacy through symbolization.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion: Toward a Deep Understanding of the Virtual</h2>
    <p>The virtual is not only a technological novelty, nor merely an illusion or simulation. It is a multifaceted phenomenon that opens up a field of reflection at the intersection of technology, philosophy, and culture. On the one hand, the strong concept of the virtual refers to a technologically mediated reality — artificial environments and augmented experiences that shape our perception of the world. On the other hand, the weak concept invites us to think about the virtual as ontological potential — as that which is not actual but can become real, and which underlies all acts of creation and imagination.</p>

    <p>In order to understand the cultural dynamics of the 21st century, we must pay attention to both levels. Only by holding together the technical and symbolic dimensions of virtuality can we grasp its full significance. The virtual is the new frontier of reality — a space where presence is redefined, where identity is fluid, and where meaning is always in motion. But this frontier is not external to us: it is already within us, in the structures of our perception, our memory, our desire.</p>
