    <h1>Three Data Temples: AI Infrastructure as a New Weapon of Power</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> July 18, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. A Physical Race for Digital Control</h2>
    <p>As the world migrates into digital space, the United States, China, and Gulf nations are investing billions in what are now called ‚Äúdata temples‚Äù ‚Äî massive AI-driven data centers. These aren't just infrastructure: they are strategic monuments to computational dominance and the future of global power relations.</p>

    <h2>2. OpenAI between Google and Abu Dhabi</h2>
    <p>OpenAI recently announced a strategic partnership with Google Cloud, marking a shift in its infrastructure strategy. Simultaneously, it is co-developing a 5 GW data campus in Abu Dhabi in collaboration with G42. The facility ‚Äî larger than Monaco ‚Äî is designed to host OpenAI models outside of the U.S., forming a new geopolitical axis between Silicon Valley and the Gulf, where compute capacity becomes the new global currency.</p>

    <h2>3. Meta‚Äôs Megaprojects: Prometheus and Hyperion</h2>
    <p>Meta is building AI megastructures under the mythic names Prometheus and Hyperion. These superclusters will power upcoming LLMs such as Llama 4 and 5, supported by Meta‚Äôs in-house chip architecture (MTIA). Some of the campuses reach Manhattan-scale proportions, signaling a new era of corporate computational independence.</p>

    <h2>4. China Goes Underwater</h2>
    <p>China is experimenting with underwater data centers off the coast of Shanghai. The pilot uses 198 server racks and sources 97% of its energy from wind. Oceanic cooling reduces energy consumption by up to 30%, allowing GPT-3.5 scale models to be trained in under a day. However, the project raises ecological concerns, including underwater noise and thermal impact on marine ecosystems.</p>

    <h2>5. Mapping the Future of Power</h2>
    <p>These three initiatives ‚Äî by OpenAI, Meta, and China ‚Äî reveal the emergence of a cognitive geopolitics where control over compute infrastructure replaces oil and territory as strategic assets. Data centers are the new industrial cathedrals: enormous, expensive, and deeply political. In a world where AI governs security, economy, and knowledge, control over compute means control over the future.</p>
