    <h1>Meta Aggressively Recruits AI Talent from OpenAI and DeepMind</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> July 3, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Meta Launches Superintelligence Lab</h2>
    <p>Meta has recently announced the launch of its own Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) lab, called the Superintelligence Lab, led by Yann LeCun. The lab aims to develop systems that surpass human intelligence across many domains. LeCun stated in an interview that “current language models are nowhere near the level of reasoning and understanding required for AGI,” prompting Meta to pursue its own vision.</p>

    <h2>2. Mass Migration of Researchers</h2>
    <p>In line with these ambitions, Meta has succeeded in attracting numerous top researchers from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and even Anthropic. At least 12 researchers are believed to have left their previous positions and joined Meta’s new lab.</p>
    <p>The recruits include former members of OpenAI’s Alignment division, researchers involved in Google DeepMind’s Gemini projects, and key personnel from Anthropic’s safety and evaluation teams.</p>

    <h2>3. High Bonuses and Talent War</h2>
    <p>According to The Information and Semafor, Meta is offering generous signing bonuses—some estimated at up to $1 million—to lure top talent. Offers reportedly include high salaries, research freedom, and access to Meta’s massive computing resources. Many analysts believe this represents the most aggressive recruitment wave in AI since OpenAI’s founding.</p>
    <p>Some researchers cited internal pressures within their previous companies as a key reason for making the switch.</p>

    <h2>4. OpenAI Response and Altman’s Comment</h2>
    <p>Asked about the departures, Sam Altman responded in a Bloomberg interview:</p>
    <p><em>“People come and go, but the mission remains the same. We are focused on building safe and useful AGI.”</em></p>
    <p>Still, experts warn that such departures could slow progress on key OpenAI and DeepMind projects, particularly in areas like model interpretability and AI alignment.</p>
