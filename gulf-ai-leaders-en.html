    <h1>Gulf AI Leaders: Dubai and Riyadh race for a post-Silicon future</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 24, 2025</p>

    <h2>New regional powers in AI geopolitics</h2>
    <p>In recent years, we‚Äôve witnessed the rise of new artificial intelligence hubs outside traditional power centers like the US, China, and the EU. Among them, the UAE and Saudi Arabia are positioning themselves as key leaders in the AI sphere, driven by a strategic vision that goes far beyond mere technology deployment.</p>

    <h2>Massive investments and infrastructure</h2>
    <p>According to reports from June 2025, Gulf countries have pledged over $2 trillion toward building AI ecosystems. The UAE is launching one of the most powerful AI energy campuses (G42), while Saudi Arabia is establishing the "Humain" hub in collaboration with Nvidia, AMD, AWS, and others. These moves are not just about tech ‚Äì they are about data sovereignty, infrastructure control, and regulatory models.</p>

    <h2>Strategic repositioning through AI</h2>
    <p>AI is being used as a tool for economic transformation, soft power, and new forms of global influence. While Western actors debate regulation and ethics, the Gulf is acting swiftly, guided by centralized leadership and vast financial resources. Their strategy is built on synergy between state power, capital, and a technocratic elite.</p>

    <h2>Unanswered questions</h2>
    <p>Can Riyadh and Dubai truly rival Silicon Valley, or will they remain advanced service nodes in global AI supply chains? The answer will shape the next chapter of AI geopolitics. One thing is clear: a region once seen solely as an energy power is now building the foundations of cognitive sovereignty.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This case reflects a broader trend: the shift of AI innovation to so-called ‚Äúneo-peripheries‚Äù where capital and strategic clarity converge. These zones are becoming critical players in shaping the future of AI civilization.</p>
