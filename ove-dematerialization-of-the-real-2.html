    <h1>The Dematerialization of the Real – Part II</h1>

    <p>It is notable that metaphysics – once the queen of the sciences – suffered most in this process. The philosophy that once posed the deepest questions about the foundation, purpose, and source of all being was reduced to epistemological commentary and analytic definitions. Instead of asking why, it asked only how. Modern rationalism, which prided itself on being liberated from dogma, in fact established its own: only what is experimentally verifiable exists.</p>

    <h2>3. The Real and the Virtual: Shifting Boundaries or Deepening Insight</h2>
    
    <p>With the development of quantum physics, the dominant materialist image of the world gradually but permanently began to change, shaking the certainty of the classical model of reality. What seemed solid, stable, and predictable now took on qualities of instability, probability, and ambiguity. What had once been exiled slowly returned: the intuition that reality might be deeper than its measurable aspects – that there might be a layer not only quantified, but interpreted. Quantum physics, though strictly scientific, opens cracks in the wall of empiricism – and through them flows again what was once called metaphysical wonder.</p>

    <p>At the quantum level, everything seems radically different. Superposition allows a particle to be in multiple places simultaneously; quantum entanglement suggests interconnectedness beyond conventional spatiotemporal frameworks; and the observer effect – where measurement influences the state of a system – points to a deep interplay between consciousness and the world. The boundary between object and subject dissolves: the observer is no longer a neutral witness, but becomes an actor in the configuration of the real. Thus – unspoken, but clear – one of the oldest metaphysical questions returns: is the world a world without consciousness?</p>

    <p>It is as if quantum physics – inadvertently – reopens the stage to what modern thought had exiled: uncertainty, relations, possibilities beyond mechanical prediction. This opens a space for a new conceptual interpretation of reality. In this framework, information increasingly becomes the new ontological currency: the fundamental unit of reality is no longer the material particle, but data, pattern, structure. If information is deeper than matter, then matter is no longer the foundation of reality. Instead, the foundation becomes relation, form, semantic structure. Ironically, the informational paradigm restores what modern science had rejected: the idea that beneath appearances there is form. In this sense, the digital does not negate metaphysics, but gives it a new architecture.</p>

    <p>In his book <em>Reality+: Virtual Worlds and the Problems of Philosophy</em>, David Chalmers – starting from the philosophy of mind and the simulation hypothesis – defends the idea that virtual worlds are also real. His argument rests on a distinction between the real and the physical. The virtual is not false; it is simply structured differently. If the experience of the world arises from the interpretation of informational patterns, then virtual environments are not mere illusions, but operational worlds with their own internal logic and reality. If the virtual is in that sense real, then our ontology must become more flexible – but also deeper. We must acknowledge that reality is not a collection of substances, but a network of experiences, interactions, and semantic fields. Chalmers thus does not offer escapism, but a call: to redefine the real in light of the possible, not only the actual.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the most provocative result of these shifts is precisely that old questions return – not as a form of nostalgic regression, but as a philosophical necessity. The question of reality can no longer be resolved by experiment alone. It calls for a new conceptual framework – perhaps a new metaphysics, one humble before the complexity of the world, but also bold enough to speak of what transcends it.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion: A New Metaphysics?</h2>

    <p>Shifting the boundaries between the real and the virtual does not necessarily mean erasing them. Rather, it leads us toward a deeper insight into the complexity of reality itself. The classical image of the world as stable, measurable substance gives way to a view in which the real is that which enables experience, relation, and meaning. In quantum physics, the philosophy of mind, and digital ontology, reality increasingly takes on the structure of fields and networks – and less that of machines and matter.</p>

    <p>In such a world, information and consciousness are not additions to reality – they are its foundation. And this opens a space for a new, as yet unspoken, metaphysics.</p>

    <p>This is precisely what the modern age often forgets: that the question of reality is not exhausted by physical models, informational simulations, or empirical observations. At its core, it is a question of meaning and origin – a question that belongs to the domain of metaphysics, no matter how much we try to translate it into the safe language of science. Perhaps it is time to restore dignity to that discarded word.</p>

    <p>It is worth recalling the distinction between ontology and metaphysics – terms often used interchangeably, though they do not mean the same. Ontology deals with the structures of being: the ways in which something exists, categories of existence, relations among beings. Metaphysics, however, seeks transcendence: it asks questions about the ultimate cause, meaning, and purpose of everything that is. While ontology analyzes the internal logic of being, metaphysics seeks its source and transcendent ground.</p>

    <p>In the modern age, ontology – in a limited sense – has survived as an analytical instrument, while metaphysics has been almost entirely expelled from serious philosophical discourse. Yet it is precisely this dimension, dismissed as unscientific, that preserved the deepest aspect of human thought: the intuition that being is not self-sufficient, but comes from something – or from Someone.</p>
