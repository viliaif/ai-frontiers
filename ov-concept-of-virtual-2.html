    <h1>Concept of the Virtual – Part Two</h1>

    <h2>Weak Concept: The Virtual as Ontological Potential</h2>
    <p>Alongside its strong technological aspect, the virtual can be understood more subtly – as a potential mode of being. In classical metaphysics, what is virtual is not unreal, but that which has the potential to become actual. This perspective allows us to grasp the virtual not only as an external product of technological development but as a deeper ontological category – one that encompasses potentiality, the not-yet, and the horizon of what may come into being.</p>
    <p>In this view, the virtual appears as a condition of possibility for emergence, creativity, and becoming. Every invention, artistic creation, or scientific discovery begins in a virtual space – a realm of ideas, intuitions, and possibilities. Thus, the virtual is not just a shadow of the real; it is the very space from which the real unfolds.</p>

    <h2>Culture as Proto-Virtual: Symbolic Virtuality</h2>
    <p>Before digital technologies immersed us in the virtual, culture had already long held us within its horizon. Language, myth, art, and ritual shape symbolic spaces that are not purely material or physical in nature, yet still mediate reality. Words, images, sounds, or signs can evoke what is materially absent, summon the possible, represent what is not here and now — and thus create a virtual field of meaning, feeling, and action. Cultural utopias also function as virtual worlds, with the potential for historical realization — which makes them politically and socially potent.</p>
    <p>Cultural reality, in this sense, has always had a virtual dimension — not as the opposite of the real, but as a way of shaping our experience of reality, both within us and outside us. The central functions of culture — storytelling, interpretation, transmission — operate not primarily through material objects, but through a virtual space of meaning: a symbolic layer that enables the transcendence of mere sensory or empirical contact with reality and opens dimensions of meaning, belonging, and spiritual presence not directly tied to the physical.</p>
    <p>When we speak of digital worlds today, we can see them as a sui generis continuation of what culture already achieved symbolically: the creation of worlds that are not here but still shape us. Technological virtuality does not create something radically new, but rather adopts the ontological pattern of culture and intensifies it — making it more present, more interactive, and more sensually persuasive.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion: Ontology of the Virtual as an Open Question</h2>
    <p>The virtual is not necessarily the opposite of the real, but may be its different, as-yet-unrealized modality — a form of presence that is not exhausted in what has been actualized by humans, but one that enables, guides, and transforms it. From philosophical concepts of possibility and potentiality, through the symbolic constructs of culture, to today’s digital worlds — the virtual emerges as a persistent structure of our relation to reality, not merely a transient technological phase. It stems from the surplus of meaning within reality itself, which always eludes our interpretations, creating the necessity and space for its new forms.</p>
    <p>In this light, the virtual demands to be thought ontologically, not just functionally. It does not only pose a question of utility but a question of human existence in reality: what does it mean to be when existence is no longer tied exclusively to material presence, but also to possibility, symbol, code, and network? What human need does the dimension of the “virtual” address? This need, it seems, is expressed today even more tangibly thanks to the involvement of the material — technology — in revealing new dimensions of human existence. Increasingly, we exist both in physical space and in the encoded. Our identities, relationships, and worlds are increasingly formed between these layers — in a virtual interspace that is both real and unreal, personal and algorithmic, possible and actual.</p>
    <p>Hence the invitation: the ontology of the virtual arises as a new field of thought — open, hybrid, dynamic. In it, we may find new modes of understanding truth, presence, and even the human itself. The virtual, as revealed here, is not merely a phenomenon of our time — it may be a new form of time itself.</p>
