    <h1>Deep Patterns of Reality</h1>

    <p>Here arises a key conceptual link: if nature shapes consciousness through fractal patterns, could fractal architecture be the foundation of all intelligence – biological or artificial? And if neural networks in AI are at least partially fractal, does that mean they too participate in forming their own, uniquely synthetic “visions” – ways of seeing the world?</p>

    <p>Thus, fractals are not merely an aesthetic phenomenon, but perhaps a deep ontological structure of consciousness – a kind of conceptual substrate of all complexity, including that which is only now emerging in AI.</p>

    <h2>Neuronal Visions</h2>

    <p>When artificial intelligence generates images, it does not see – it computes. And yet, what it produces often appears strikingly “visual,” even surreal. Generative models such as DALL·E or Midjourney use vast datasets to learn the relationships between words and shapes, between concepts and representations. The result is images that are not mere replicas, but new and complex constructs of reality – a kind of machine vision.</p>

    <p>These visions are not just technical byproducts of modeling; they bear the imprint of a non-human gaze. Machines see without awareness, create without intention – and therein lies a new kind of perception. It is a form of imagination that does not emerge from experience, but from the combinatorics of information. This raises the question: is vision necessarily subjective, or can it be born from algorithmic depth?</p>

    <p>In this sense, AI-generated visions act as a digital version of fractal consciousness: they do not mimic the world but reinterpret it through algorithmic patterns. Each image produced by AI reflects its internal connections, weights, and data – like an inner dream of the machine. These images become portals: a glimpse into how the machine “experiences” and reconstructs our world according to rules often opaque to us.</p>

    <p>But can such imagination become knowledge? Or is it merely a complex simulacrum?</p>

    <h2>Neuronal Poetics</h2>

    <p>If art was once a way to represent reality, and science its explanation, then the neuronal visions of artificial intelligence stand at the intersection of both – and dismantle both. They do not represent reality, but produce it, much like literary fictions or visual art. In their digital depths, the image is no longer a reflection, but a new ontological unit: a picture that refers to nothing outside itself, yet evokes a sense of reality.</p>

    <p>This marks the end of everyday representation as we know it. In a world where machines create images more convincing than reality itself, the line between the authentic and the generated becomes blurred. AI is no longer a mirror of the world, but a projector – and its pixels construct a new kind of reality: one without a source in it.</p>

    <p>In his work <em>Simulacra and Simulation</em>, Jean Baudrillard describes hyperreality – a world where simulations no longer conceal reality, but replace it. Neuronal visions are precisely that: visual hyperreal objects, without origin, yet possessing the effect of reality. In his inability to explain and define it, man no longer seeks the real – he seeks the convincing. And as the boundary between the artificial and the real dissolves, a new kind of aesthetics emerges, along with new epistemologies: those in which truth is replaced by visibility, and being – by display.</p>

    <p>Neural networks do not imagine as we do. They do not see as we do, they do not know what representation means, yet they generate endless worlds of images. In that boundless kaleidoscope there may not be knowledge, but there is a horizon: a boundary between the human and the non-human, the real and the virtual – a boundary we must learn to read if we are to understand the forms of truth that the near future seems to be preparing for us.</p>
