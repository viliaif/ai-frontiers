    <h1>Global AI Industry Value Exceeds $500 Billion</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 18, 2025</p>

    <p>Artificial intelligence is becoming one of the core drivers of the global economy. According to recent analyses, the total value of the AI industry worldwide has surpassed $500 billion in 2024, with projections indicating it could reach $1 trillion by 2030, and up to $2 trillion by 2040.</p>

    <p>The United States leads the market with an estimated $146 billion, followed by Canada with nearly $44 billion. The European Union collectively holds $66 billion, with Germany and the United Kingdom as key players. The Asia-Pacific region is surging, with China aiming to surpass $1.8 trillion by 2030. Japan, South Korea, and India are also strengthening their positions‚Äîespecially India, which is expected to more than double its market from $8 billion to $17 billion by 2027.</p>

    <p>Growth is fueled by several key sectors: foundation and generative models (OpenAI, DeepMind, Anthropic), cloud infrastructure (AWS, Microsoft Azure, NVIDIA), specialized AI chips (GPU, NPU), and vertical AI applications in healthcare, finance, defense, and education. A rising segment includes AI-BCI (brain-computer interface) integrations‚Äîstill early, but attracting growing investment.</p>

    <p>The geopolitical implications are profound. AI is no longer just a technology‚Äîit is a strategic resource. The U.S. currently leads in private AI investment, with over $100 billion per year, significantly ahead of China and the EU. Europe is responding with large-scale initiatives such as the ‚ÄúAI Gigafactory‚Äù for supercomputing infrastructure. Meanwhile, Asian nations are rapidly aligning strategies to secure influence in the emerging AI order.</p>

    <p>As artificial intelligence moves from the technical domain into the realm of global power structures, the struggle to control it will shape future economies, governance, and meaning-making across societies.</p>
