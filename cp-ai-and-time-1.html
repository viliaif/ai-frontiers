    <h1>AI and Time</h1>

    <p><em>Time is arguably one of the most pervasive, yet most opaque categories in human life — a truth beautifully captured by Michael Ende, author of The Neverending Story, in these words:</em></p>
    <p>“The world holds a great secret, one that is known to all. We are all part of this secret, all aware of it, yet few people truly think about it. That secret is — time.”</p>

    <p>Time is not merely the passage of moments — it is the fundamental framework of our understanding of reality, the net through which we interpret events and relationships.  
    But what if that framework begins to shift from within — not just culturally, but technologically?  
    Technology accelerates, fragments, and destabilizes our temporal orientation, while algorithms increasingly dictate the rhythms of reality.  
    Are we still living within a single time — or have we already entered a world of parallel streams: human and digital, organic and artificial?</p>

    <h2>1. Dimensions of Human Time</h2>
    <p>Time is not merely a physical quantity — it is an existential framework through which human beings interpret the world, act, and give meaning to their existence. Since the earliest cultures, time has been tied to the rhythms of nature, memory, and the anticipation of the future. Culture and time are so intertwined that one could say they are one and the same: culture is the symbolic ordering of reality, and time its fundamental organizing principle.</p>

    <p>The history of thought on time — from Plato, Augustine, and Kant to Einstein and Heidegger — reveals that time is not a fixed fact, but a living horizon of meaning. Our understanding of time is not static — it is fluid and subject to transformation, just like the social paradigms that shape its interpretation. With modernity, time increasingly becomes an economic resource. Capitalist culture accelerates, fragments, and instrumentalizes time. Every second becomes a space for efficiency; leisure is perceived as a luxury, and necessary duration is replaced by algorithmic calculation.</p>

    <p>In contrast to this profane model stands the idea of anti-time — sacred time that does not flow linearly but repeats and renews. Mircea Eliade, in his work <em>The Sacred and the Profane</em>, distinguishes between the linear time of history and the sacred time of myth: cyclical, archetypal, and eternal.</p>

    <p>Anti-time, in this sense, is not an escape from reality but a return to its depth. It is not the negation of time, but its purification. If modern time is measured by money, then anti-time reveals that which cannot be measured: presence, depth, contemplation — a duration that does not flow, but simply is.</p>

    <h2>2. AI and Time: A New Ontology of Time Without a Future?</h2>
    <p>In his work <em>Being and Time</em>, Heidegger emphasized that being-in-time is the foundation of human existence. Time is not merely the framework within which humans exist — it simultaneously shapes their consciousness and experience of being. But where does artificial intelligence stand within that temporal structure? Can AI, in any meaningful way, be-in-time? In other words: what happens when human experience of time meets technological temporality?</p>
