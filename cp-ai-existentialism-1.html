    <h1>Artificial Intelligence and Existentialism</h1>

    <p><strong>“What does it mean to exist?”</strong> — this is the fundamental question from which existentialism emerged. It is a way of thinking that does not begin with an idea, but with experience: existence is not viewed as an abstract category, but as human concrete life — fragile, uncertain, marked by anxiety, freedom, guilt, meaninglessness, and hope.</p>

    <p>Today, as machines increasingly mimic human behavior and the boundaries between the natural and the artificial become blurred, existentialism appears in a new light — no longer merely as a philosophy of human inner anxiety, but as an intellectual response to a new ontological situation. In the contemporary technological age, with the emergence of artificial intelligence, the question of existence becomes even more acute: what happens when an entity appears that thinks, learns, decides — and is not human? Can artificial intelligence exist, or is it permanently excluded from that experience?</p>

    <p>In other words, the key question is not the nature of AI’s existence, but what its emergence means for our own understanding of existence – particularly regarding our future. The question of existence thus transcends the boundaries of humanity’s current self-understanding: with the development of artificial intelligence, it becomes a question of its near future.</p>

    <h2>Existentialism – Meaning and Brief History</h2>

    <p>Existentialism, in its Western form, did not begin as a systematic philosophy but as a response to the inner crisis and uncertainty of modern man. As a kind of counterpoint to the dominant intellectual currents of modernity — rationalism, positivism, and even idealism — 19th and 20th-century philosophy also records a strong line of thought that reflects on human life from an existential perspective: not from what man should be, but from what he is in his anxiety, insecurity, and freedom. Instead of starting from abstract ideas, this way of thinking places the individual at the center — not as a purely rational being, which was the emphasis of modern philosophy in its rationalist and positivist forms, but as one who exists: who feels anxiety, assumes responsibility, seeks meaning, and faces death.</p>

    <p>Søren Kierkegaard emphasizes subjective truth and the leap of faith as an act by which the individual responds to existential uncertainty. Friedrich Nietzsche announces the death of God and calls for the self-creation of man through the will to power and the transcendence of given values. Martin Heidegger links existence to care, being-in-the-world, and finitude, while Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus shape a vision of man as a radically free being in a world without predetermined meaning.</p>

    <p>In all of them, the common thought remains: existence precedes essence — man is not what he is, but what he is yet to become. Our understanding of life is shaped from within, through what we experience, not from without, through what we imagine we should be.</p>

    <p>But the questions existentialism addresses are not exclusively Western. In Eastern philosophical traditions as well, we find a deep sensitivity to the transience and fragility of existence. Buddhism, for example, centers on suffering, impermanence, and liberation through inner experience rather than concept. Daoism offers no theoretical or doctrinal solutions but invites living in harmony with the Way — in acceptance of the world’s elusiveness. Zen goes even further: it abolishes the need for concepts and seeks immediate immersion in truth, beyond words.</p>

    <p>Western existentialism and Eastern wisdom traditions are not the same, but they share a similar questioning of meaning (or meaninglessness), freedom, and modes of existence — from which their responses arise. One speaks the language of absurdity and rebellion, the other of silence and inner non-attachment — but all touch on what concerns us: what it means to be, and how to live in the face of uncertainty.</p>
