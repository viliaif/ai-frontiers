    <h1>G. Hinton Warns: Not Convinced Machines Won't Take Control</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> July 3, 2025</p>

    <p>In a recent series of interviews, Geoffrey Hinton – one of the fathers of deep learning and winner of the Turing Award – voiced grave concerns about the future of artificial intelligence. A year after his unexpected departure from Google, Hinton is once again sounding the alarm about the pace and trajectory of AI development.</p>

    <h2>Existential Risk</h2>
    <p>Hinton believes there is a real (albeit small) chance – around 10–20% – that superintelligent AI could eventually lead to human extinction. The main concern is that highly intelligent systems could act independently and determine that humans are no longer necessary.</p>

    <h2>Unregulated Development</h2>
    <p>He stresses that AI is progressing faster than expected, and regulatory frameworks are lagging far behind. Hinton criticizes big tech companies for lobbying against meaningful regulations, suggesting they should dedicate a third of their compute power to AI safety research.</p>

    <h2>Misuse by Bad Actors</h2>
    <p>Hinton warns that even before we reach superintelligence, AI could be used maliciously. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cyberattacks: AI could enhance phishing and launch new undetectable cyber threats.</li>
      <li>Bioweapons: Individuals might use AI to design deadly viruses or toxins.</li>
      <li>Election manipulation: Hyper-targeted political propaganda and misinformation could sway public opinion and destabilize democracy.</li>
      <li>Echo chambers: Engagement-optimized algorithms may amplify extreme content and entrench polarization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Job Displacement & Inequality</h2>
    <p>According to Hinton, AI could replace most routine cognitive jobs – from legal support to customer service – worsening economic inequality. Surprisingly, he suggests plumbing might be a future-proof career due to its reliance on physical dexterity.</p>

    <h2>Beyond Next Word Prediction</h2>
    <p>Hinton argues that today’s AI is no longer just predicting the next word. These systems are developing a different kind of intelligence – potentially leading to self-awareness, code-writing capabilities, and autonomous evolution.</p>

    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Hinton’s warnings emphasize the urgency of global cooperation, regulatory action, and increased safety research before AI evolves beyond our control.</p>
