    <h1>Sam Altman: We've Crossed the Event Horizon ‚Äì The Gentle Singularity Begins</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 18, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In June 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman published a public text stating that humanity has already entered the early stages of the technological Singularity. But rather than a sudden, revolutionary rupture, Altman describes what he calls a <strong>gentle singularity</strong> ‚Äì a gradual yet unstoppable shift into the era of digital superintelligence.</p>

    <h2>From Wonder to Expectation</h2>
    <p>Altman claims that we have passed a critical threshold ‚Äì the <em>event horizon</em> ‚Äì after which there is no turning back. AI no longer amazes; it is expected. People are shifting from surprise to habit:</p>
    <blockquote>‚ÄúWe will quickly go from being amazed at an AI that can write a beautiful paragraph to expecting it to write a beautiful novel.‚Äù</blockquote>
    <p>AI is no longer just a tool ‚Äì it is an intelligent presence shaping everyday life. From medical diagnosis to programming, expectations are changing rapidly.</p>

    <h2>The Next 5 Years: A Critical Period</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>2025:</strong> AI agents handle complex coding tasks</li>
      <li><strong>2026:</strong> systems begin uncovering new scientific insights</li>
      <li><strong>2027:</strong> robots enter the physical world</li>
      <li><strong>2030:</strong> intelligence becomes ubiquitous</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Values, Power, and Decentralization</h2>
    <blockquote>‚ÄúAvoid centralized control by any one person, company, or country.‚Äù</blockquote>
    <p>Altman calls for a global conversation on ethical principles, long-term goals, and the development of systems that serve humanity rather than short-term interests.</p>

    <h2>Ontological Reflection: A Singularity Without Explosion</h2>
    <p>Altman‚Äôs vision is not of dramatic change, but a new perception of time and expectation. The Singularity happens not through shock, but through the <strong>quiet transformation of what feels normal</strong>.</p>
    <blockquote>‚ÄúThe Singularity is not a moment ‚Äì it is a sequence of moments in which miracles become routine.‚Äù</blockquote>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Altman‚Äôs gentle singularity is not a call for passivity, but for awareness. As technology becomes a thinking companion, the key question is: who sets the direction?</p>
    <blockquote>‚ÄúMay our march toward superintelligence proceed smoothly, exponentially, and silently.‚Äù</blockquote>
