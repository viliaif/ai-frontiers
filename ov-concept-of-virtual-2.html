    <h1>Concept of the Virtual – Part Two</h1>

    <h2>Weak Concept: The Virtual as an Ontological Possibility</h2>
    <p>Although the concept of the virtual entered broader usage primarily in the context of digital technology, it has deep philosophical and ontological roots in the tension between the possible and the actual—a tension that opens up space to understand it as a mode of existence rather than merely a surrogate for reality. The virtual—understood as that which is not actual but can be—has existed under other names since Aristotle. His distinction between <em>dynamis</em> (potentiality) and <em>energeia</em> (actualization) suggests that reality is not exhausted by what appears but also includes what could be.</p>
    <p>In Scholastic philosophy, especially in Thomas Aquinas, we find the term <em>virtus</em>—an inner power or potency of something, not yet expressed but really present. This is precisely the origin of the word “virtual,” derived from the Latin <em>virtus</em>, which signifies strength, efficacy, a possibility awaiting realization. Etymologically, then, “virtual” does not mean false or unreal, but rather something that possesses the power of being, though not yet actualized. Later, Henri Bergson would introduce the concept of <em>duration</em> (<em>durée</em>) as an unbroken flow encompassing what is not yet actual, while Gilles Deleuze in the 20th century would explicitly conceptualize the virtual as real but non-actualized—as a positive ontological dimension.</p>
    <p>In all these instances, the virtual is not seen as illusion or copy but as a real possibility—something that exists in its own way, even if not physically present. Thus, the virtual gains a deeper meaning: it is not opposed to the real but is its alternative modality—an “actualizable” form of being that precedes actuality and makes it possible.</p>

    <h2>Culture as Proto-Virtual: Symbolic Virtuality</h2>
    <p>Long before digital technologies immersed us in the virtual, culture had already held us within its horizon. Language, myth, art, and ritual shape symbolic spaces that are not exclusively material or physical in nature, yet still mediate reality. A word, image, sound, or sign can evoke what is materially absent, call forth the possible, present what is not here and now—and thus create a virtual field of meaning, sensation, and action. Cultural utopias also function as virtual worlds, with the potential for historical realization—which is precisely what makes them socially and politically dangerous.</p>
    <p>Cultural reality has always had a virtual dimension—not as the opposite of the real, but as a way of shaping our experience of reality, both within and outside of us. The central functions of culture—storytelling, interpretation, transmission—do not operate primarily through material objects but through the virtual space of meaning: a symbolic layer that enables the transcendence of mere sensory or experiential contact with reality and opens dimensions of meaning, belonging, and spiritual presence that are not directly tied to the physical.</p>
    <p>Today, when we speak of digital worlds, we may understand them as a <em>sui generis</em> continuation of what culture has already done symbolically: the creation of worlds that are not here, but nevertheless shape us. Technological virtuality, therefore, does not create something radically new but rather adopts the ontological pattern of culture and intensifies it—making it more present, interactive, and sensorially convincing.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion: Ontology of the Virtual as an Open Question</h2>
    <p>The virtual is not necessarily the opposite of the real; rather, it can be its different, as-yet-unrealized modality—a form of presence that is not exhausted by what is actualized by human beings but enables, directs, and transforms it. From philosophical concepts of possibility and potency, through the symbolic constructs of culture, to today’s digital worlds—the virtual reveals itself as a persistent structure of our relation to reality, not merely a transient technological phase. It arises from the surplus of meaning in reality, which always escapes our interpretations, creating both the necessity and the space for its new forms.</p>
    <p>In this light, the virtual demands to be thought ontologically, not merely functionally. It does not only raise the question of function, but of human existence within reality: what does it mean to be, when existence is no longer tied solely to material presence, but also to possibility, symbol, code, and network? To which human need does the dimension of the “virtual” respond? Today, this need seems to express itself even more tangibly thanks to the involvement of the material—technology—in revealing new dimensions of human existence. Increasingly, we exist both in physical space and in coded space. Our identities, relationships, and worlds are increasingly formed between these layers—in a virtual in-between space that is both real and unreal, both personal and algorithmic, both possible and actual.</p>
    <p>Hence the call: the ontology of the virtual emerges as a new field of thought—open, hybrid, dynamic. In it, we may perhaps discover new modes of understanding truth, presence, and even the human being. As it appears here, the virtual is not merely a phenomenon of our time—it may be a new form of the time of existence.</p>
    <p>The contemporary form of the virtual may, in a more acute form, raise a question that echoes as a negative paraphrase of Leibniz’s theodicy: are we truly living in the only (possible) world? As Marcelo Gleiser beautifully shows in his book <em>The Island of Knowledge</em>, the history of human intellect reveals that the expansion of the boundaries of knowledge has simultaneously meant the expansion of the boundaries of reality itself.</p>
