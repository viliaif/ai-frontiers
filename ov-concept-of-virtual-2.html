    <h1>The Concept of the Virtual – Part II</h1>

    <h2>The Weak Concept: The Virtual as Ontological Potential</h2>

    <p>Although the term "virtual" entered broader usage through digital technologies, it has deep philosophical and ontological roots in the tension between the possible and the actual — a tension that opens space for understanding it as a mode of being, not merely a surrogate of reality. The virtual — understood as what is not actual but could be — has been present since Aristotle. His distinction between dynamis (potentiality) and energeia (actualization) points to a reality not exhausted by appearances but inclusive of what could be.</p>

    <p>In Scholastic philosophy, especially with Thomas Aquinas, we find the term virtus — an internal power or potential that has not yet been expressed but exists in reality. The word "virtual" itself stems from the Latin virtus, indicating strength, efficacy, or potential awaiting realization. Thus, etymologically, "virtual" does not mean false or unreal, but something that has the power of existence without being actualized. Later, Henri Bergson introduced the concept of durée (duration) as an unbroken flow that includes what is not yet actual, while Gilles Deleuze in the 20th century explicitly treated the virtual as real but non-actual — a positive ontological dimension.</p>

    <p>In all these examples, the virtual is not understood as illusion or copy, but as a real possibility — something that exists in its own way, even if not present in the physical sense. Hence, the virtual is not opposed to the real but is a different modality — a “potential” form of being that precedes actuality and makes it possible.</p>

    <h2>Culture as Proto-Virtual: Symbolic Virtuality</h2>

    <p>Before digital technologies immersed us in the virtual, culture had already long held us within its horizon. Language, myth, art, and ritual shape symbolic spaces that are not exclusively material or physical in nature, but nonetheless mediate reality. Words, images, sounds, or signs can evoke what is materially absent, summon the possible, or present what is not here and now — thereby creating a virtual field of meaning, sensation, and action. Cultural utopias also function as virtual worlds with the potential for historical realization — which is precisely what makes them politically and socially potent.</p>

    <p>Cultural reality has thus always had a virtual dimension — not as the opposite of the real, but as a way of shaping our experience of reality, both internally and externally. The central functions of culture — narration, interpretation, transmission — do not primarily operate through material objects, but through the virtual space of meaning: a symbolic layer that enables us to transcend mere sensory or experiential contact with reality and opens up dimensions of significance, belonging, and spiritual presence not directly tied to the physical.</p>

    <p>When we speak today of digital worlds, we can understand them as a sui generis continuation of what culture has already long done symbolically: creating worlds that are not "here," yet shape us nonetheless. Technological virtuality does not invent something radically new but adopts the ontological pattern of culture and intensifies it — making it more present, interactive, and sensually convincing.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion: The Ontology of the Virtual as an Open Question</h2>

    <p>The virtual is not necessarily the opposite of the real, but rather a different, not-yet-actualized modality — a form of presence that is not exhausted by actualization but enables, guides, and transforms it. From philosophical concepts of possibility and potency, through symbolic constructions of culture, to today’s digital worlds — the virtual appears as a lasting structure of our relationship to reality, not merely a passing technological phase. It arises from the surplus of meaning in reality, which always eludes our interpretations, thus creating the necessity and space for its new forms.</p>

    <p>In this light, the virtual demands to be thought of ontologically, not merely functionally. It raises not just questions of function, but of human existence in reality: what does it mean to be, when being is no longer exclusively tied to material presence but also to possibility, symbol, code, and network? What human need does the dimension of the "virtual" respond to? Today, this need seems to be expressed more tangibly precisely because of the involvement of the material — technology — in revealing new dimensions of human existence. More and more, we find ourselves in both the physical and the coded space. Our identities, relationships, and worlds increasingly arise between these layers — in a virtual in-between space that is both real and unreal, both personal and algorithmic, both possible and actual.</p>

    <p>Hence the invitation: the ontology of the virtual emerges as a new field of thought — open, hybrid, dynamic. Within it, we may discover new modes of understanding truth, presence, and perhaps even the human itself. The virtual, as presented here, is not merely a phenomenon of our time — it may be a new form of the time of existence itself.</p>

    <p>In its modern form, the virtual perhaps poses in sharper terms a question that sounds like a negative paraphrase of Leibniz’s theodicy: do we truly live in the only (possible) world? As Marcelo Gleiser beautifully shows in his book <em>The Island of Knowledge</em>, the intellectual history of humanity shows that expanding the boundaries of knowledge has always meant expanding the boundaries of reality itself.</p>
